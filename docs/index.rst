BASTA: The BAyesian STellar Algorithm
#####################################

**Welcome to BASTA's documentation!**

BASTA is a Python-based fitting tool designed to determine properties of stars using a pre-computed grid of stellar
models. It calculates the probability density function of a given stellar property based on a set of observational
constraints defined by the user.

Current stable version: v1.5.0

*******************************

There are two articles containing the rationale, main features, and capabilities of the code:

* `The BASTA paper I <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.452.2127S/abstract>`_
* `The BASTA paper II <https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14622>`_

Please consider citing these articles if you use BASTA in your work, and include the link to the code's repository
``https://github.com/BASTAcode/BASTA``.

Due to its versatility, BASTA is used in a large variety of studies requiring robust determination of fundamental
stellar properties. We have compiled a (non-exhaustive)
`list of papers using BASTA results <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/x2tCt52HR_yqG-oaUabo_A>`_
that showcases these applications. If your paper using BASTA results is missing from the list please contact us.
