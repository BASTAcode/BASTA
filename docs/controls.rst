All controls
============

The following sections give the full overview and documentation of the control options in BASTA.
For simple examples of how BASTA is run, see instead :ref:`examples`.

The methods employed are described in the :ref:`BASTA papers<ref_refs>`, while the following is
the documentation of how the controls for these methods are adjusted. The documentation follows
the structure of the :py:func:`define_input` template function in ``BASTA/examples/create_inputfile.py``,
separated into individual sections for each control group (python dictionary) being:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    controls_io
    controls_fit
    controls_output
    controls_plots
    controls_intpol
