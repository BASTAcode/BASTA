Examples of fits
================

The following sections give practical examples of commonly used fits with BASTA, and explain the options in the code

**Important note** A reference set of output is located in ``${BASTADIR}/examples/reference/`` and includes all fits
described in the following sections. These can be compared to the output you obtain when running the code as a further
sanity check.
