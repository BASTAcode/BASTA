**Important note:** BASTA is developed for Python 3.9, but Python >= 3.7 should work as well.


## Before you begin

*Please follow the repository here on GitHub to get notifications on new
releases: Click "Watch" then "Custom" and tick "Releases.*

Please have a look at [our documentation](https://basta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#).

There we have written a guide [guide to installing
BASTA](https://basta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

On there, you will also find an [introduction to running
BASTA](https://basta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html).

If you are curious on what BASTA can do, we have created several [fitting
examples](https://basta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) and the exact
code to run them available.


## References and acknowledgments

There are two papers containing the rationale, main features, and capabilities
of the code:

* [The BASTA paper I](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.452.2127S/abstract).
* [The BASTA paper II](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.4344A/abstract).

Please cite these references if you use BASTA in your work, and include the link
to the code's repository `https://github.com/BASTAcode/BASTA`.

Due to its versatility, BASTA is used in a large variety of studies requiring
robust determination of fundamental stellar properties. We have compiled a
(non-exhaustive) [list of papers using BASTA
results](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/x2tCt52HR_yqG-oaUabo_A)
that showcases these applications. If your paper using BASTA results is missing
from the list please contact us.
